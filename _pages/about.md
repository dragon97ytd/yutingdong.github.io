Hi everyone, my name is yutingdong, nice to meet you!
I obtained my Master's degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
where I focused on computer vision and deep learning. 
My research interests include image understanding, object detection, and visual perception for real-world applications. 

During my graduate studies, I interned at Haomo.AI, where I worked on perception algorithms for autonomous driving, 
including multi-sensor fusion and vision-based environment understanding. 
After graduation, I joined SenseTime, continuing my work in computer vision research and large-scale AI system development.
